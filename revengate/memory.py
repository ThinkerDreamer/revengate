""" How we store everything that happened to an actor """

# Design
# - events.StatusEvent has almost all the info that we need, we just need to save then 
#   when they occur
# - event.ttl can allow us to garbage collect stale events
# - do not store explicit object references to keep it pickleable

# Use Cases:
# - actor wants to know who is the last person to hit them
# - monster goes back to a safe spot that it knows about
# - repeat the previous attack that proved the most effective, not necessarily the last 
#   one
# - player reviews important quest goals / hints (maybe not for the memory class)
# - find the nearest exit out of a level (based on knowledge of the level, not the 
#   current level)
