Coding style and conventions
============================

* max line length is 88
* pos, which stands for position is always an (x, y) tuple in carterian coordinates (origin at bottom left corner).
* funct, not func: a Python callable
* action and ftag: a string referencing a registered Python function; must be resolved before it can be called
* params, not parms
* when in doubt, name things after steam engine parts or concepts at the core of the industrial revolution
