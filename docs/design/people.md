## François Ravaillac
One of the greatest assassins all time.

## Foujoi Porans
Small time criminal who aspires to become a great assassin like Ravaillac. He takes jobs from from Franconian nobles: vandalizing shops and beating up people who have attracted the hatred of the influential. Porans does not care for politic, but since most of his clients are royalists, he is likely to favour that faction if he is really pushed to make a call.

He maintains his protection racket by leading a small group of thugs. He is pretty good at fist fighting (savate style). He can use a dagger, but he is pretty much useless with longer blades. Promises of training about poisons and toxins are likely to influence him.

Porans is tall and skinny, sporting a long dark mustache and a poorly shaven face in general. He has a hawk nose and dark brown eyes. More often then not, you will see him in a blue double breasted vest, shirt sleeves rolled up, bowler hat on his head. Some knife fight scars are obvious on his left wrist.


## Le Grand Salapou
Le Grand Salapou is the manager of several circuses roaming the world. He started his career as a clown and for the most part, he still is one. He still wears makeup and goofy outfits and plays magic tricks randomly as he goes through his day.

Now in his 50's, he gained mastery in many of the circus skills though the year. Beware of his slight if hand if you ever come in close quarter with him. He will easily pick pocket you as he pretends to let you search him and he could plant a poisoned needle in your shoulder while dodging a sword strike. He is a trained actor, so abandon hope of reading him and be very weary of his persuasion skills. 

With circuses in a dozen cities at any given time, Salapou controls a substantial network of spies and smugglers. The profit from smuggling finances the underground activities of the enterprise. Salapou has a life long dedication in putting smiles on people's faces. He can't stand the chronically negative types and he is genuinely concerned about the contagious nature of their affliction. As such, Salapou's underground business often deals with the removing these incurable individuals from society.

Because he is always seen in character, very few would be able to recognize him if he was to venture out in civilian attire. He has a strong stature and is significantly overweight, probably around 250 lbs by the look of it, but some speculate that this is part of his costume. Dishevelled, mismatched clothing with a checkered jacket and a bowler hat two sizes two small is how he appears more often than not, but he is versatile with his look and has been seen is flashy – and obviously goofy – outfits when performing for influential audiences.

## Pridout Fauchève
Pridout Fauchève is a smuggler who seems able to source the most elusive goods. Nobles and scientists alike go to him to for luxury and rare materials. He controls the only supply chain of various exotic herbs used in religious and occult rituals, making him a very powerful individual a presumably a very wealthy one as well.

Fauchève has a tribal view of the world: members of his clan before anything else. He is strongly against letting addictive substances ruin youth in the name of profit. He values connections and information more than money.

He sports low key heavily worn sailor outfits. His face is animated by nervous ticks making his dark full beard dance like it's hosting a small family of squirrels.
