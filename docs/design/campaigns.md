## A Tangle of Roses
2021-10-19

A noble merchant from Lyon is suspecting that his wife is cheating on him and is seeking an investigation. He is himself in love with another woman but has not committed to the illegitimate union besides romantic talks and letters.

People:
- Bertrand Faveresse: a wealthy spice trader
- Mélissandre Faveresse: Bertrand's wife
- Pierre Dupont: poet and song writter, in love with Mélissandre
- Leila Jalal: daughter of a rich Moroccan spice trader, Bertrand is in love with her

Bertrand Faveresse is a successful spice trader. His work takes him away from his house frequently, be it to spend time at the port to inspect the cargo of incoming ships or to travel to distant cities to find buyers for his goods and open new trade routes. He suspect that something is going on with his wife and hires La Compagnie des Lumières (our employer) to investigate. 

Bertrand Faveresse suggests a way through the traboules (a network of underground passages in Lyon) to discretely reach his backyard and spy on his wife unnoticed. As most traboule runs go, the way is not entirely free from dangers. This is our first real dungeon crawl!

Upon reaching the backyard, the hero discovers a poem written on a weathered sheet and signed by Pierre Dupont, a former political activist. When La Compagnie learns that Dupont is Mélissandre's lover, they strongly advise us to keep the love affair alive in order to keep Dupont away from his old political propaganda writing business. Bertrand on the other hand would rather see him dead.

In any case, our evidences are too weak so we have to look for Dupont to confront him. This will lead us through some shady warehouses near the port, our second dungeon crawl. Dupont readily confesses. Killing him on the spot is an easy victory. Or...

We can also confront Mélissandre to gather a stronger case, there are two ways there since we don't need to be secretive anymore: the safe streets, or the more adventurous traboules. Mélissandre won't confess anything unless shown the tattered poem. When she does, she also voices her own suspicion regarding Bertrand's faithfulness.

Reporting back to both Bertrand and La Compagnie, we are offered two options. Bertrand recommends a discrete assassination of his own wife via the traboules, La Compagnie is in favour of investigation Mélissandre's claim to see if that could lead to a more peaceful resolution.

Following Mélissandre's leads will bring us to Paris. Once there, the catacombs are the ideal ways to discretely reach various backyards and conduct our spying. Those not being as safe at the traboules, our dungeon crawls increase in difficulty. It's easy to see how much time Bertrand spends with Leila and to make a connection. A whiff of her perfume when meeting Bertrand in person eliminates any doubts.

The mission from then on is to learn more about her. A few bribes to the right persons gives us all the information we need. La Compagnie wants us to give Bertrand enough of a nudge that he will finally express his love to Leila. For Leila to be seduced in return, our advisors recommend sweetening the deal with fine silks and well crafted poems and sourcing those falls on our lap. Fines silks are very easy to find in Lyon, perhaps our hero even had the foresight to buy some before travelling to Paris. Poems can either come form Dupont for free or can be sourced for a fee in any of the numerous absinthe lounges scattered through Paris. 

When victory is almost at hand, Leila's father wants her back in Casablanca. We can make her stay in Paris by finding her a job as a diplomat, a piece of cake if we pay the right bribes. Doing so must be done with lots of discretion, which will take us though the catacombs one more time.

Leila falls in love with Bertrand, whom stops caring what Mélissandre does in back in Lyon. This is the highest scoring victory possible. It also comes with influential connections that can be used in later campaigns.
