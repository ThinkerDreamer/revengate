The Revengate World
===================

Revengate takes place in a steampunk parallel universe closely based on Earth in the Victorian era.  Magic exists, human races are more spread out than they are on our Earth, guns are still impractical, Europe is widely developed, but so are many other cities around the world.

## World
The game starts in 955 AD, which roughly corresponds to 1855 of our world. The setting is Victorian era Franconia, located roughly where modern France is. 

Technology, science, and medicine is comparable to that of 1855 of our world, except for a few specific discoveries that came a couple decades early or a couple decades late. The industrial revolution is getting started. Guns are all impractical muzzle loaders. Magic is fairly common and its proponents are at odd with the industrial elite. Electricity is rare, steam and clockwork mechanisms are the main sources of mechanized work. Hot air balloons can be seen once in a while, steerable airships are about to be invented.

There are many ideological conflicts in the world: science vs magic, democracy vs autocratic rule, hedonism vs industrial efficiency, colonialism vs local autonomy. In time, the hero will get to pick a side for many of these conflicts, with pro and cons on both sides of the conflicts.

## Look and feel
Movies with the adequate feel include:
* The Prestige (2006)
* Sherlock Holmes (2009)

The action taking place in Franconia rather than London, everything is a little more decorated and a little less industrial. Some early hints of Art Nouveau can be seen here and there. Men almost all sport a beard or a mustache and have some kind of headwear: newsboy caps, bowler hats, top hats. Corsets and crinolines are very common elements of ladies fashion.

Cafés and absinthe lounges are very popular in Franconia.

## Currency
The Franc has the same purchasing power as $5 USD of our era, roughly one basic meal. Franconia has wide reaching trade routes and one can trade in Francs in most ports around the world, but they will have to trade in local currency or in gold if they venture further inland outside of Franconia.

## Places

- Franconia: roughly modern day France
- Saxonia: roughly modern day England
- Prussia: roughly modern day Germany

## Organizations 

### La Compagnie de Lumières

The game starts with the hero being recruited by the Compagnie des Lumières, an underground organization that hires field agents to further its pro-science agenda. The elitist organization is not in favour a democracy, preferring an autocratic rule by an educated few. The Compagnie is very well financed and can provide advanced equipment and training to the hero after he or she succeeds in a handful of missions.
