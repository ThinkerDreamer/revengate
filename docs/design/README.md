# Design Notes

This directory contains information on the fictional world of Revengate and on the game mechanics. 

## Spoiler Warning

There is a lot of information here that a player is expected to learn piece by piece while playing. In some cases, the game won't explicitly tell the player and her or she is expected to figure it out. If you elect to read on, know that some of the magical mystery of the game will be dispelled.  You have been warned.
