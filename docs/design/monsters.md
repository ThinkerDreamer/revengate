# Monsters 

## plasus rats
Plasus rats are vicious rodents. Usually reddish brown with a stripped bald tail. They are much bigger than Norwegian rats: from the size of a house cat to that of a beaver. They have the general shape of a Norwegian rat, except that their face is stubbier, a bit like a gerbil.

Their sharp incisors can shred leather with ease and will chew through wood in just a few minutes. They are avid climbers and can jump up to two meters. They dislike the smell of cinnamon. They frequently carry diseases and they are immune to most poisons.


## Sulant tigers
Sulant tigers have the general shape and size of a Bengal tiger, but they are all light brown with light green stripes. Their backs have spines like those of porcupines and their tail is twice as long as that of a Bengal tiger.

Sulant tigers use their tails as monkeys do to grab objects or the limbs of unsuspecting adventurers who venture too close. Some say that their spines can cause poisoning. They can perceive electrical currents in their vicinity, some are also sensitive to magnetic fields.


## loquilases (was torachs)
Loquilases are basically large badgers with rigid scales on their head and back. Their scales often feature colourful intricate line patterns. More often then not, the line patterns are too flashy to serve as effective camouflage.

They are very aggressive, jumping on anything that they perceive as either food or as a threat. They can stun a target who is within their grasp with an electrical shock. They can jump up to two meters high and they are perfectly immune from induced fear from intimidation, toxins, or magic.


## Nochorts
Nochorts have the general allure of a moose standing on its hind legs. Thankfully, they are much smaller, typically 2.5m from head to toes (3m if you count the antlers). The can wield weapons with their three-fingered hands. Their considerable strength give devastating swings to those weapons.

Nochorts are strictly vegetarian, but they won't hesitate to attack any sentient being that they consider a foe. They live in highly hierarchical society and rarely question authority. They are employed by many organizations because of this loyalty. 

Due to their size, they have a hard time negotiating tight passages.


## Éguis
Éguis are what you get if a cobra had libs. They stand like a kangaroo using two legs and their tail. They are smart enough to use weapons and will invariably take offense at being compared to a snake, which they view as an lower life form. Most are 140 to 160 cm tall form head to toes (longer from head to tail). Very old individuals can reach 2m.

Éguis are master of assassination, patient and cunning. You will rarely see one fire a gun, they prefer quiet and discrete alternatives like blow darts and shurikens. 


## Automatons
Automatons are machines with limited power reserves. The most common, the clockwork automaton, uses wind-up springs as it's power reserve. Less common ones are powered by gas or electricity. Automatons are strictly reactive with a wide range or sensors and triggering mechanisms. Their size can range from that of a medium sized dog something as big as a four horse carriage. Automatons are made of wood and metal, giving them good resistance to most damages except fire.

They vary greatly in shapes, from four wheeled buggies to walking bipedal armed with pole arms.
