# Monsters 

## plasus rats
Plasus rats are vicious rodents. Usually reddish brown with a stripped bald tail. They are much bigger than Norwegian rats: from the size of a house cat to that of a beaver. They have the general shape of a Norwegian rat, except that their face is stubbier, a bit like a gerbil.

Their sharp incisors can shred leather with ease and will chew through wood in just a few minutes. They are avid climbers and can jump up to two meters. They dislike the smell of cinnamon. They frequently carry diseases and they are immune to most poisons.


## Sulant tigers
Sulant tigers have the general shape and size of a Bengal tiger, but they are all light brown with light green stripes. Their backs have spines like those of porcupines and their tail is twice as long as that of a Bengal tiger.

Sulant tigers use their tails as monkeys do to grab objects or the limbs of unsuspecting adventurers who venture too close. Some say that their spines can cause poisoning. They can perceive electrical currents in their vicinity, some are also sensitive to magnetic fields.


## Sahwakoons (was torachs and loquilases)
Sahwakoons are basically large badgers with rigid scales on their head and back. Their scales often feature colourful intricate line patterns. More often then not, the line patterns are too flashy to serve as effective camouflage.

They are very aggressive, jumping on anything that they perceive as either food or as a threat. They can stun a target who is within their grasp with an electrical shock. They can jump up to two meters high and they are perfectly immune from induced fear from intimidation, toxins, or magic.


## Nochorts
Nochorts have the general allure of a moose standing on its hind legs. Thankfully, they are much smaller, typically 2.5m from head to toes (3m if you count the antlers). The can wield weapons with their three-fingered hands. Their considerable strength give devastating swings to those weapons.

Nochorts are strictly vegetarian, but they won't hesitate to attack any sentient being that they consider a foe. They live in highly hierarchical society and rarely question authority. They are employed by many organizations because of this loyalty. 

Due to their size, they have a hard time negotiating tight passages.


## Éguis
Éguis are what you get if a cobra had limbs. They stand like a kangaroo using two legs and their tail. They are smart enough to use weapons and will invariably take offense at being compared to a snake, which they view as an lower life form. Most are 140 to 160 cm tall form head to toes (longer from head to tail). Very old individuals can reach 2m.

Éguis are master of assassination, patient and cunning. You will rarely see one fire a gun, they prefer quiet and discrete alternatives like blow darts and shuriken. 


## Automatons
Automatons are machines with limited power reserves. The most common, the clockwork automaton, uses wind-up springs as it's power reserve. Less common ones are powered by gas or electricity. Automatons are strictly reactive with a wide range or sensors and triggering mechanisms. Their size can range from that of a medium sized dog something as big as a four horse carriage. Automatons are made of wood and metal, giving them good resistance to most damages except fire.

They vary greatly in shapes, from four wheeled buggies to walking bipedal armed with pole arms.


## Bouncy Ocotillo (ambush plant)
Ambush plants look like regular plants, but they can sense approaching adventures and react in a way that causes damage.

The bouncy ocotillo vaguely looks like a Sonoran ocotillo with five to ten branches radiating from a central root system. The branches are mostly straight, but slightly wavy, forming a 15º to 30º cone. The branches are covered in sharp spines, 1cm to 2cm long, and grow 1m to 2m tall. Branches may be covered in round leaves as large as the spines or they may be bare of any leaves during dry spells.

The bouncing ocotillo differs from the Sonoran one by the presence of a web of radiating reeds, also fanning from the central root stem. The reeds are tipped by a ball of fine hairs like paper reeds. The reeds are about half as tall as the spiky branches.

The name of the plant comes from the reaction when something touches the reeds: almost instantly, one of the branches (or more) will move in that direction before springing back, causing severe puncture wounds to the trespasser in the process.

Every few years, the plant will bloom. Its flowers are very similar to those of Sonoran ocotillo, but they are purple instead of red. The plant is very poisonous while in bloom.

## Snare Yucca (ambush plant)
Ambush plants look like regular plants, but they can sense approaching adventures and react in a way that causes damage.

The snare yucca vaguely looks like an agave. It's a succulent plant with thick triangular leaves with sharp serrations on two of the three sides. The leaves can be ass long as two meters tall, but one meter is more common.

Spreading underground from the centre of the plant is a rhizome network. The network can span up to 5m in radius. Scattered across the network are small mushrooms-like growths. When disturbed, the domes o those growths will launch spores in all directions. The spores themselves are perfectly inoffensive, but if they come in contact with the main leaves, they cause those to twist and contract, causing slicing damage to nearby adventurers and possibly ensnaring them. The contraction is very swift, then the leaf will slowly unfurl back to its original position over the course of several minutes, unless something is trapped in its embrace, in which case, the leaf can remain curled for several days.

The plant blooms once every several years. It grows a long stalk about 50% taller than its leaves. The flower blooms at the top of the stalk. The flower is said to be very beautiful, full of bright colours with a strong smell of orange blossoms. For reasons of practicality and safety, those flowers are rarely harvested. 


## Labras
The labra is a gliding reptile. It's front claws deploy like the praying mantis forearms. Claws are slightly curved, sharp and serrated, 20cm to 40cm long. 

Labras stand on their back legs like many dinosaurs did, using their tail for balance. The front claws are usually held retracted until the moment of the attack. In this position, it looks like a mantis, but with four limbs rather than six. 

Connected to the first joints from the body on each limb is a membrane that also runs along the torso. The membrane is usually held retracted and in this position, it merely looks like a skin flap. When all limbs are extended, however, the membrane deploys like a sail and allows the labra to glide great distances. 

The head of the labra looks like that of a caiman with rows of sharp teeth that are visible whether the mouth is open or closed. The labra can snap it's jaw with great force.

The typical specimen measures 60cm to 1m tall from head to toes, 120cm to 2m from their nose to the end of their tail. Most specimens are plain green, but some display elaborate skin patterns similar to many snakes.

They can leap twice as high as they are tall. Only the back paws are prehensile.


## Sentry Scarabs
Sentry Scarabs are very large insects, measuring up to 75 cm in length. They look like horned beetles standing on their four back legs in the fashion of mantis. Their front limbs are equipped with two powerful claws that vaguely resemble those of crabs.

They have vestigial wings, but due to their weight, they are incapable of flight. They can however flap their wings to produce some wind or to moderately break a fall.

Their thick exoskeleton is very resistant to cuts. Their joints are less well protected, but the small horn-like protrusions along their limbs act like the hand guard on a sword to block block direct attacks so aiming for joints requires a lot of dexterity.

They are rather slow, moving roughly at the pace of a brisk walking average human. They can climb on most vertical surfaces, except the most polished ones. The less textured a surface is, the slower the vertical progress is.

Lire regular scarabs, they tend to display elaborate patterns and flashy colours on their body, including metallic and iridescent light effects.

Sentry scarabs have a high mental capacity for insects due to their large head size. They can be trained and a few individuals can collaborate in the resolution of simple tasks. 

## Pacherrs
Pacherrs are human-sized bipedal wholly mammoths. They are essentially the closest one gets to Tolkienan dwarves: stubby with elaborate braiding on their long facial wool. Celtic knots are often carved in the ivory of their tusks, less commonly, jewels are also set in their tusks.

They rarely go taller than 1.5m, but because they are greatly muscular, 100kg is pretty much as light as an adult can be. Thanks to their massive head, they are also much smarter than the typical human can be.  Their clothing has a lot in common with Cossack attires, including robe-like gowns and long coats for males as well as fluffy hats. 

Pacherrs come from nomadic tribes in Eastern Russian. They form strong bonds within their clan and will readily help any individual within the clan. Clans have a matriarchal structure with an elder female having the final word on internal affairs.

Among themselves, Pacherrs love music and dancing with both genders taking interchangeable roles in their traditional dances. Their music often includes the tambourine and the balalaika. 

They are adept at fencing with the shashka sabre. The typically lack the finesse of human duellists, which they compensate for with the fantastic power of their swings. They are also generally proficient with pole arms. They sometimes have trunk attachments that serve as weapon, the trunk-morning-star being a common one.

They are all strictly vegetarian, but otherwise, they do not advocate for the nature conservancy. They ascribe to a view of a world in change where nature's role evolve depending on the era. They tend to be more strongly opinionated with the relative place of various human and Pacherr factions, but who they would like to see at the top largely depends on which clan they are from.


## Bears
The world of Revengate is filled with various kinds of bears. There are the common ones who also inhabit our world, like the black bear, the grisly bear, and the panda; and there are some that are unique to Revengate, like the moon bear and the short faced bear.

All bears share similar characteristics and attach styles. The species of a bear dictates how strong of a foe it's going to be and to some extent, it's level of aggression. Unsurprisingly, pandas are the least aggressive and rarely attack unless provoked while polar bears are the most aggressive and will almost always attack on sight.

Bears all have a very powerful sense of smell. With it, they can detect heroes who hide around corners. They can all climb and sprint for short distances, which is the basis for their charge attack. Given their considerable mass, a bear charge can deal a lot of damage and even knock a hero off their feet. 

Bear are not social and are rarely seen in groups except for a mother with young cubs. A mother with cubs will always be more aggressive than other individuals from the same species. 

Bears attack with their sharp front claws, which do slashing damage, and with their bites, which does piercing damage. Their attack range is short, but their thick fur offers a lot of protection so their can easily get into close-range combat.

Bears can often be distracted by food, especially smelly and sweet ripe fruits.


## Raccoons (including sahwakoon)
Raccoons and sahwakoons share common behaviours. Both are very smart, but raccoons are smarter and have more dexterous front paws, which allows them to solve a wider range of problems. 

Raccoons are the most social of the two. They can form groups of up to five. Their communication being limited, they do not coordinate attacks, but they have been seen helping one another for simple tasks, such as climbing over a tall structure.

Raccoons can easily grab objects, but they have not been seen using them as tools or weapons. They will readily steal objects from adventurers, including their weapons, but they will rarely run away with the object they just stole.

Rabid raccoons are the ones who have been infected by rabies. They are more aggressive than healthy individuals and can pass on the virus to humans. Unless vaccinated, humans almost never survive rabies. 

Raccoon claws inflict slashing damage, but they are not particularly sharp. Their teeth are sharper and they inflict piercing damage. Their thick fur offers a surprisingly high amount of protection for an animal of this size. 

It is rumoured that raccoons can be trained and that pet raccoons can steal items from enemies. If this turns out to be true, that would make these avid climbers very valuable companions on many dungeon adventures. 

## Phantruch
A phantruch is a magical creation. At first glace, it is a creature floating inside a wisp of blue flames.

A major phantruch has an insect-like oval shaped torso that features a head and four limbs. Two of the arms are spider like, hairy, long and stiff, one with a crab-like pincer and one with a dagger shaped claw. The two other arms are soft tentacles tipped with suckers, a bit like those of squids. There are no legs, the thing simply floats.

The part of the creature that is inside the blue flame is ethereal and semi-transparent. When a body part ventures outside of the flames, like for an attack, it instantly become solid and tangible. 

The head is roughly triangular and features four eyes. The are many horns and spikes around the head, but no visible mouth.

And the center of the creature floats the "vital assemblage", a frame of wood and brass housing an intricate mechanism that keeps the creature animated. The frame is adorned with writing in the ancient Aramaic script. Inside the frame there are four crystals arranged in the shape of a tetrahedron pyramid and a complex clockwork set of gears and springs constantly moving with a soft ticking sound. The vital assemblage has a very solid look to it despite being at the very center of the flames. 

When a phantruch dies, the creature and the flames completely evaporate, but the vital assemblage remains. Any damage to the vital assemblage is likely to cause the creature to vanish.

The lesser phantruch is help in animation by only two crystals. The weaker magical pulled produced by those simpler vital assemblages cannot reach as far in between the planes of reality and the creature nesting inside the blue flame is therefore much different.

The creature of the lesser phantruch resembles a cross between a moray eel and a Chinese dragon. The serpent like beast remains coiled around the vital assemblage until the time of the attack. It attacks by springing forward with the swiftness of the cobra. As it floats in the air, the creature really seems to be swimming. Just like for the greater phantruch, the creature is ethereal and semi-transparent while it remains inside the blue flames.

The lesser phantruch creature has diminutive arms like a Chinese dragon. Behind the head are protruding external gills somewhat similar to those of an axolotl. There are no eyes and no nostrils. How it senses it's enemy is a mystery. 

The simpler vital assemblage of the lesser phantruch is still very intricate. The assemblage simply floats in mid-air without any visible attachment points. Sometimes the outline of a portal is visible as a two dimensional triangle. The equilateral triangle has one point facing down to the ground and emits a faint glow. It is about half as big as the creature. 

If the creature manages to snatch an item and to drop it inside the blue flame, the item will soon vanish into oblivion, never to be found again.
